- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- keras
- scikit-learn
- Sastrawi
- wordcloud


### Libraries Used
The project utilizes several Python libraries for data processing and machine learning. Key libraries include:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
- nltk: For natural language processing tasks.
- keras: For building and training neural network models.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- Sastrawi: For Bahasa Indonesia stemming and stopword removal.
- wordcloud: For generating word clouds.


### Algorithms and Models
The specific algorithms and models used in this project were not explicitly mentioned in the notebook. However, it involves using machine learning models for sentiment classification, likely including techniques such as:
- Neural networks with layers like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
- Data preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- Model evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy score.
